# 🕸️ Webify.ai-v2

---
A fast **AI-powered website generator** for smaller, clean websites, built with Flask + OpenAI's Responses API.  
Webify.ai-v2 is the successor to **Webify.ai** — rebuilt from the ground up to be faster, cleaner, and far more polished.  
Think of it as a **v0 / Lovable-inspired site builder** that turns your ideas into a quick prototype.
AI-assisted frontend design; implemented backend and APIs from scratch.

### ✨ Features

- ⚡ **AI Website Generation** – Just describe the site you want, and Webify builds it for you.  
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS Styling** – Modern, responsive designs out of the box.  
- 🧠 **Improved Model Integration** – Uses the `o3` with `max_output_tokens` for long, coherent outputs.  
- 🖼 **Live Preview Page** – See the generated site on its own page, not just in a box.  
- 🔄 **Regeneration Support** – Easily tweak prompts and generate again.  
- 🧰 **Modular Code** – Clean separation of backend logic (`model.py`) and templates.
