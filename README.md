# 🕸️ Webify.ai-v2

A fast **AI-powered website generator** for smaller, clean websites, built with Flask + OpenAI's Responses API.  
Webify.ai-v2 is the successor to **Webify.ai** — rebuilt from the ground up to be faster, cleaner, and far more polished.  
Think of it as a **v0 / Lovable-inspired site builder** that turns your ideas into a quick prototype.
AI-assisted frontend design; implemented backend and APIs from scratch.
